Boss 1: Hover Bomber
	Spawns after getting far enough from the boss door
	Boss door locks with a spinning blade that can kill you
	Behaviour:
		Locates player location
		Drives to it and updates player location after reaching it
		Speed is determined by number of coils (black and green cylinders)
		Shoots large fireballs (kinda pointless to be honest)
	How to fight it:
		Preferred weapon: Assault Rifle
		Shoot at the shield until it begins to spark
		Wait for the shield to fail
		Shoot out a coil (shield regenerates after destroying one)
		Repeat until only the platform is left to shoot
		Shoot platform and wait for the fire to finish it off
		Slow it down early by destroying 1 coil so it slows down a little so you can avoid it
		After that, keep sprinting away (in a circle works fine) while facing it
		Make sure you do not run out of stamina, or else it'll catch up to you
		
Boss 2: Hacking Console
	Activates when you get in range
	Blocks exit with fire (which burns you to death, even touching it will light you on fire)
	3D prints two melee aliens every two seconds beside you
	How to fight it:
		Stand in front of it to begin hacking it
		When hacking, a description will appear of your current progress
		Keep standing there for two seconds until the message changes to "Please Wait..."
		From here you may/should leave the console to kill off the aliens while it processes
		Once the message changes to "Press any key," you can go back to hacking it
		There are ten stages to hacking this boss
		Once the last hack is complete, the 3D printer will deactivate

Boss 3: Monitors
	A force field locks you in after entering the room
	There are also several ranged aliens
	The force field depletes all of your ammo so you can fight back
	You need to destroy all three monitors regardless
	How to fight them:
		Play dodgeball!
		Stand in front of the monitors and dodge fireballs until the monitors break (begin to spark)
		Break all three
		Don't worry about getting the aliens to shoot each other, the last one can't kill himself anyway
		Once all the monitors are destroyed, the aliens' life support fails and they die over time
		You won!
